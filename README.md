# Neural-Network
## Project Objective
- This project is for my self study of deep learning by implementing neural network from scratch using python.

- There are 3 implementations goals:
  1. Fully connected neural network (Finished)
  2. Convolution neural network (Updating)
  3. Recurrent neural network (Updating)
  
- The current version supports **He Initialization**, **Dropout**, and **ADAM Optimization**. Future version I'm looking forward to implement **Batch Normalization**.

## Project Demonstration
- Please visit https://github.com/vinhng10/Neural-Network/blob/master/testing.ipynb for the small demonstration.
