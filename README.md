# Neural-Network
## Project Objective
- This project is to get me familiarize with deep learning by implementing neural network from scratch using python.
- There are 3 implementations goals:
  1. Fully connected neural network (Finished)
  2. Convolution neural network (Updating)
  3. Recurrent neural network (Updating)
  
## Project Demonstration
- Please visit https://github.com/vinhng10/Neural-Network/blob/master/testing.ipynb for the small demonstration.
